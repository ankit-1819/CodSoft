## **Student Grade Calculator 🎓**

Just completed a Student Grade Calculator in Java! Here's a breakdown of the features:

### 🖥 **Student Input**:
- Students are prompted to enter their name, number of subjects, and marks for each subject.
- The program adjusts dynamically based on the number of subjects, making it flexible for various academic setups.

### 📊 **Grade Calculation**:
- After entering marks, the program calculates the total marks by summing all subject scores.
- The average percentage is then computed, and a grade is assigned based on the percentage:
  - **A** for 90% and above
  - **B** for 80% to 89%
  - **C** for 70% to 79%
  - **D** for 60% to 69%
  - **F** for below 60%

### 💾 **Data Persistence**:
- The program stores student data in a file (**students.txt**) after processing, ensuring that records are preserved across multiple runs.
- It can retrieve and update data in subsequent sessions, and will automatically create the file if it doesn't exist.

### 📝 **Edit Functionality**:
- Students with existing records can view their previous data and update their marks and grades.
- The updated records are saved back into the file, keeping data accurate and current.

Feeling accomplished and ready to tackle new challenges! 🚀

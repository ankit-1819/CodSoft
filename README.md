ðŸš€ Just Wrapped Up My Java-Based ATM Project! ðŸ’» ðŸš€

Iâ€™m thrilled to share my latest coding accomplishmentâ€”a feature-rich ATM system developed in Java! ðŸŽ‰ Hereâ€™s what makes it special:

ðŸ”’ Unique User Login: Every user gets a unique account with secure login, ensuring personalized access. No more overlapping usernames!

ðŸ’¾ Data Persistence: Implemented file handling to save user data seamlessly. Even if the system shuts down, all account informationâ€”like balances and transaction historyâ€”is securely stored and reloaded. No data left behind!

ðŸ’° Deposit & Withdrawal Features: Added functionality for safe and reliable deposits and withdrawals, with instant balance updates.

ðŸ§© This project challenged me to blend data security, user experience, and efficient coding practicesâ€”an exciting and rewarding experience!
